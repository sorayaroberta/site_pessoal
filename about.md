Hello, everyone! I'm speaker, writer, podcaster and PhD Student in Computer Science at Federal University of Pernambuco. I'm from Brazil, but currently I'm living in Paris-France. I hold a BSc in Information Systems and a MSc in Innovation in Educational Technologies. In my High School I created the Literaly Manifest Compiled Poetry (Poesia Compilada in Portuguese). I love to developer projects that envolved code, art and education. Print("I'm Pyladies")
